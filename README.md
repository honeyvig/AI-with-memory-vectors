# AI-with-memory-vectors
In the context of AI, a memory vector typically refers to an internal data structure or representation used by the model to "remember" information over time, helping it make better decisions or generate responses based on previous interactions.

One common example of AI models with memory is transformers (like GPT-3) or systems that use vector embeddings for storing and accessing previous context.

For a local AI with memory (like a chatbot or a recommendation system), you can store memory vectors in a vector database or a file system. In this code example, we'll show how you might create a simple local memory-based AI system using Python and a vector-based memory approach.
Use Case: Memory-based AI System with FAISS

We will utilize FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to handle memory vectors. FAISS allows us to store embeddings and query them efficiently, making it suitable for a local memory-based AI system. It is a popular library for similarity search and clustering.

Here’s how you might implement a simple local memory-based AI chatbot:
Step-by-Step Implementation:

    Install dependencies: First, you will need to install FAISS and OpenAI's GPT-3 API (if you're using GPT for context generation).

    pip install faiss-cpu openai numpy

    Create a simple memory system using FAISS: FAISS will store vectors (like embeddings) and provide fast retrieval of the most relevant memory.

Python Code Example:

import faiss
import numpy as np
import openai
import json

# Set up OpenAI API Key (you can replace this with your own key)
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

# FAISS Index Setup
d = 512  # Dimensionality of the vector embeddings
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)  # L2 distance for similarity search (Euclidean)

# Memory storage - A simple list to store past queries and responses
memory = []

# Function to generate embeddings using GPT (or other models like BERT, etc.)
def get_embedding(text):
    response = openai.Embedding.create(
        model="text-embedding-ada-002",  # GPT-3 embeddings model
        input=text
    )
    return np.array(response['data'][0]['embedding'])

# Function to add new memory to the vector index
def add_to_memory(user_input, bot_response):
    user_input_embedding = get_embedding(user_input).reshape(1, -1)
    bot_response_embedding = get_embedding(bot_response).reshape(1, -1)

    # Store the embeddings in FAISS
    index.add(user_input_embedding)
    index.add(bot_response_embedding)

    # Save the memory with both input and response
    memory.append({"user_input": user_input, "bot_response": bot_response})

# Function to retrieve relevant memory based on new user input
def retrieve_memory(user_input):
    query_embedding = get_embedding(user_input).reshape(1, -1)

    # Search the FAISS index for the closest vectors (memory)
    _, indices = index.search(query_embedding, k=1)
    if indices[0][0] != -1:
        most_similar_memory = memory[indices[0][0]]
        return most_similar_memory
    else:
        return None

# Function to generate a response from the bot, integrating memory
def generate_response(user_input):
    # Check if there is any relevant memory
    relevant_memory = retrieve_memory(user_input)
    
    if relevant_memory:
        # If memory found, use it as context
        context = f"User: {relevant_memory['user_input']} \nBot: {relevant_memory['bot_response']} \nUser: {user_input} \nBot:"
    else:
        # If no relevant memory, use default context
        context = f"User: {user_input} \nBot:"

    # Use OpenAI's API to generate a response with the context
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=context,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    
    bot_response = response.choices[0].text.strip()

    # Store the input and response in memory
    add_to_memory(user_input, bot_response)

    return bot_response

# Main loop to simulate a conversation
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Welcome to the AI chatbot with memory. Type 'exit' to stop.")
    
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
            break
        
        bot_response = generate_response(user_input)
        print(f"Bot: {bot_response}")

Explanation of the Code:

    Embedding Generation (get_embedding):
        The function get_embedding calls OpenAI’s Embedding.create method to generate embeddings for both the user’s input and the bot’s responses. These embeddings are vector representations that capture the semantic meaning of the text.

    Memory Storage with FAISS (add_to_memory):
        The memory is stored in FAISS, where each piece of input/output data is added as an embedding. This allows the system to retrieve past interactions based on semantic similarity.
        Every time a user interacts with the bot, the input and corresponding response are stored in FAISS for future retrieval.

    Memory Retrieval (retrieve_memory):
        When the user inputs a new query, we generate an embedding for the query and search FAISS for similar embeddings.
        If there is a close match, the bot will refer to past interactions to improve the current response.

    Bot Response Generation (generate_response):
        The bot uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate responses. The context for the response is either the previous interaction or just the user’s query if no relevant memory is found.

    Main Loop:
        A simple loop that allows continuous interaction with the bot. The loop keeps the conversation going until the user types “exit”.

Key Components Used:

    FAISS: Used for storing and searching vector embeddings.
    OpenAI API: Used for generating text embeddings and bot responses.
    Numpy: Used for numerical manipulation of embeddings.

Possible Use Cases:

    Customer Support Chatbots: This memory-based AI can help improve customer service by remembering past interactions, improving the overall experience.
    AI Assistants: Personal assistants that remember user preferences over time and give more personalized responses.
    Recommendation Systems: Using memory vectors to recommend products, services, or content based on previous interactions.

How This AI Memory Works:

    As the AI interacts with users, it remembers previous conversations by storing their inputs and corresponding outputs in vector embeddings.
    When a new user input is received, it uses FAISS to search the stored memory for semantically similar interactions and enhances the new response using past context.
    Over time, the memory base grows, and the AI becomes more intelligent by learning from past conversations.

This simple AI with memory vectors can be expanded and enhanced by incorporating more sophisticated models, neural networks, and techniques to improve its memory and response generation.
